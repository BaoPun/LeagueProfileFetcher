# LeagueProfileFetcher
This project uses the Qt Framework in order to create a widget that will help search for League of Legends players across multiple regions.

Upon a successful lookup, the initial window will show the summoner's solo queue and flex queue ranks, followed by their top 10 most played champions.

In addition, the user can click on the generated icons from the champions to get a better description of their abilities and to also view all their possible skins.
